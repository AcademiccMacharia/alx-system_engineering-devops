## Regular expressions

Regular expression is a pattern that can match repeating characters or strings. Different languages use different regexp machines.
Very handy for `log parsing`.
In this repository, the regular expressions are built using `Oniguruma`, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Hello there! This repository is all about explaining what happens behind the scenes when you type in **https://www.google.com"** and hit enter. From DNS requests to load-balancers, firewalls to web and application servers, we will cover every step of the process to give you a better understanding of how the internet works.

In this repository, you will find a link to a funny but informative blog post on the same topic to make the learning experience more enjoyable.

Feel free to explore the repository and leave any feedback or comments you may have. Your feedback is always appreciated and helps me improve my work.

Thank you for stopping by and happy learning!

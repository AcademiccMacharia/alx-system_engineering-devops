### Networking basics 2

![localhost](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/285/s7kpNYq.png)


In this directory, I got to delve into localhost, which is a hostname used to refer to the current device used to access network services that are running on the host via the loopback.
I also got to delve into `hosts file` which is a plain text file that all operating systems use to translate hostnames into IP addresses.

The table below explains the files present in this directory.

| **Files** | **Description** |
| ------- | ------- |
| `0-change_your_home_IP` | Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server resolving localhost to `127.0.0.2` and facebook.com to `8.8.8.8` |
| `1-show_attached_IPs` | Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on |
| `100-port_listening_on_localhost` | Bash script that listens on port `98` on `localhost` |

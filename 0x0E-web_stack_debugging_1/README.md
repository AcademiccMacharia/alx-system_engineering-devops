This directory seeks to deepen my debugging skills, helping me be able to find problems and fix them.

Through broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions I am able to work on my debugging skills.

The table below contains all the files in this directory as well as their descriptions:

| **Files** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------- |
| `0-nginx_likes_port_80` | Debugging why my Ubuntu container's Nginx intallation is not listening on port 80 |
| `1-debugging_made_short` | Making my fix for the above short and sweet |

In this directory, I explore APIs in depth. I get to utilize Reddit API since there's a lot of endpoints available, and there's tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

The below is a table containing the files that will be in this directory, as well as their description.

| **Files** | **Description** |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `0-subs.py` | Function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit |
| `1-top_ten.py` | Function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit |
| `2-recurse.py` | Recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit |
| `100-count.py` | Recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces.) |
